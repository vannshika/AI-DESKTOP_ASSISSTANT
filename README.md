# AI-DESKTOP_ASSISSTANT
This Python project implements a voice-activated desktop assistant.
It leverages the speech_recognition library to understand spoken commands and the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech responses.
The assistant performs tasks like opening Google and YouTube using the webbrowser library, playing songs via the pywhatkit library, and taking screenshots using pyautogui.
It provides a hands-free experience, enabling users to interact with their computer through voice commands, making it both practical and user-friendly.
